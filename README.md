WELCOME WELCOME

Join me as we learn/ revise the 2000 high frequency words in Korean.

Once you are done with this list; 

1. You can find more words here:
https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/blob/master/content/2018/ko/ko_50k.txt

2. Use google sheets to paste your selection.
   
3. Use paste formating to split text to columns. Delete the 2nd column with the frequency count.
   
5. Use this formula in cell A1 to translate into Korean, drag to translate the remaining words.
=GOOGLETRANSLATE(A1, "ko", "en")

6. Save this page and download it as a csv file.

7. You can now replace the previous csv file, remember to keep the file name consistant.

I hope you enjoy this as much as I am.
